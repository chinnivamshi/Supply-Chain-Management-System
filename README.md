Introduction
Food traceability is crucial in ensuring the quality, safety, and authenticity of products throughout the supply chain. This application provides a solution by leveraging Blockchain technology, which enables a transparent and immutable record of each transaction. By storing the data on the Blockchain, it becomes practically impossible to alter or tamper with the information, ensuring trust and accountability.

Moreover, the application incorporates Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for securing and validating transactions. ZKP allows for the verification of a statement's truthfulness without revealing any additional information. This ensures privacy and confidentiality while maintaining the integrity of the data.

Features
Blockchain-based Data Storage: The application utilizes Blockchain technology to store data, providing an immutable and transparent record of transactions.
Transaction Validation with ZKP: Zero Knowledge Proof is employed to secure and validate transactions, ensuring trust and integrity.
Traceability and Transparency: Users can easily track and verify the origin, manufacturing processes, and distribution details of food products.
Secure Authentication: The application employs secure authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and maintain data privacy.
User-friendly Console Interface: The console-based interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, enabling easy interaction with the application.


Installation
